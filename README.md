How to choose among a million different credit cards and maximize cash 
back rewards?

# assumption: set up a range of spending on dining/entertainment and 
grocery shopping, per month
# choose a distribution
## uniform distribution
Between the range of min and max spending on each category, assum all 
values have the same probability.
## normal distribution
Assume the likelihood of a particular value decreases as it moves 
further away from the mean.
# calculate cash back
For each assumption of distribution, make 1000 simulations, apply cash 
back percentage based on credit card company information.
# visualization
Make histograms of each card's 1000 simulations. Extract the mean or 
median. Make a decision.

Easy Peasy!
