# How to choose among a million different credit cards and maximize cash back rewards?

# make some assumptions
Predict a range of spending on each spending category, in this case, dining/entertainment and grocery shopping, per month
## choose a distribution
### uniform distribution
Between the range of min and max spending on each category, assum all 
values have the same probability.
### normal distribution
Assume the likelihood of a particular value decreases as it moves 
further away from the mean.
## calculate cash back
For each assumption of distribution, make 1000 simulations, apply cash 
back percentage based on credit card company information.
## visualization
Make histograms of each card's 1000 simulations. Extract the mean or 
median. Make a decision.

Easy Peasy!
